        Content or Scenario
      </h2>    
      <p>This is a website about an agricultural company that grows fruits in Tambogrande, Piura, and offers stable-quality natural fruits. 
        The company's goal is to grow top-quality fruit on its own land in the dry tropical ecosystem of Tambogrande Piura, Peru.  
        Importantly, the goal is to encourage people to join as members to get great benefits.
        The questions that they could ask are: “What are the benefits? How these benefits can help me in my life? How can I know this is true?” I will respond: “Here are many benefits what it will make you comfortable, and you will get more information about how to work through product sales and generate more income. 
        You will acquire more knowledge about caring for the environment and basic fruit crops. 
        Furthermore, there will be lectures on how we can grow good crops and how to gain the trust of our customers.
        What's more, you would benefit more if you supported us more financially. You will be a big part of this company, and if you want to buy some of our products, you will get a 70% discount on the prices.”
